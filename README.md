# Hi üëãüèª I'm Kenny

I'm currently working on exploring how to build a better, more decentralized Internet with Bitcoin and Stacks.

Right now, I'm focusing on developer education and outreach for the Stacks Foundation.

Stacks is a L1 blockchain that settles on Bitcoin, allowing developers to build robust, transparent, and secure decentralized applications on top of the world's most secure blockchain.

## My Work
- [Starting Stacks](https://start.stacks.org) - A roadmap for developers interested in getting started developing on Stacks.
- [Web3 for Bitcoin](https://www.crowdcast.io/e/web3-for-bitcoin/) - An overview of the what, why, and how of building on Stacks. Good intro for the curious.
- [Stacks DEV Page](https://dev.to/stacks) - Stacks tutorial content for developers
- [FreeCodeCamp Writing](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/author/ken-rogers/) - Writing I've done for the excellent FreeCodeCamp
